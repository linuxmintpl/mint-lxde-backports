Description-en: GNU C preprocessor (cpp)
 The GNU C preprocessor is a macro processor that is used automatically
 by the GNU C compiler to transform programs before actual compilation.
 .
 This package has been separated from gcc for the benefit of those who
 require the preprocessor but not the compiler.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default GNU C preprocessor.

Description-md5: 4eec63ec6a45894436866732b96c2698
Description-en: Fix non-ANSI header files
 FixIncludes was created to fix non-ANSI system header files. Many
 system manufacturers supply proprietary headers that are not ANSI compliant.
 The GNU compilers cannot compile non-ANSI headers. Consequently, the
 FixIncludes shell script was written to fix the header files.
 .
 Not all packages with header files are installed on the system, when the
 package is built, so we make fixincludes available at build time of other
 packages, such that checking tools like lintian can make use of it.

 SpaceFM is a multi-panel tabbed file and desktop manager for Linux with

 A descendant of PCManFM, SpaceFM's aims are to be bugfixed, efficient
 (mainly C), hugely customisable (change and add to the GUI as you go
 with Design Mode), powerful without scaring off newer users (due to
 customisation), independent of particular distributions and desktop
 environments, and device management featureful enough to replace the
 various udisks-based *kits when used alongside udevil.
 .
 Other highlights include optional desktop management, smart queuing
 of file operations, user plugins and the ability to carry out specific
 commands as root.
 .
 Please install spacefm-gtk3 instead if you want to stick with GTK+3.

Package: spacefm-gtk3
Description-md5: f2c573502cee17440115c318f4119a3f
Description-en: Multi-panel tabbed file manager - GTK3 version
 SpaceFM is a multi-panel tabbed file and desktop manager for Linux with
 built-in VFS, udev or HAL-based device manager, customizable menu system
 and bash integration.
 .
 A descendant of PCManFM, SpaceFM's aims are to be bugfixed, efficient
 (mainly C), hugely customisable (change and add to the GUI as you go
 with Design Mode), powerful without scaring off newer users (due to
 customisation), independent of particular distributions and desktop
 environments, and device management featureful enough to replace the
 various udisks-based *kits when used alongside udevil.
 .
 Other highlights include optional desktop management, smart queuing
 of file operations, user plugins and the ability to carry out specific
 commands as root.
